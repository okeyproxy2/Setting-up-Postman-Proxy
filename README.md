2. Postman Settings
   
Click on the gear icon at the top right corner and select “Settings”.

Navigate to “Proxy”. Disable “Use system proxy” and enable “Use custom proxy configuration”.

Select HTTP and HTTPS as the “Proxy type”. Choosing both means both types of requests will pass through the proxy server.

Use the proxy address and port obtained from the OkeyProxy dashboard for the “Proxy server”.

Turn on “Proxy auth” and enter the username and password from your OkeyProxy endpoint generator.

Specify hosts to bypass the proxy settings in “Proxy Bypass”.

Close the window to complete the setup process. Ensure changes are saved successfully.

By following these steps, you can seamlessly integrate OkeyProxy into Postman for efficient usage.
